# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m AndrÃ© (@4nR3), IT Student
## Welcome to my Github profile.
  
Here you can found the codes of some of my projects.
Most of them I did during my vocational high school studies in computer science at E.E.S.T.NÂ°5 de Merlo, Argentina, and the Certified tech developer and Backend specialist carrers at Digital House.
I have also created a portfolio if you wish to see the projects in a visual way.

You can contact me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9-alvarez-574160208/).
